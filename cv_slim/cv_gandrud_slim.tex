%%%%%% Positions  %%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\section*{Work Experience}

\noindent I build teams that solve more problems, faster. Automated auction systems generating \textbf{hundreds of millions of euros}. A/B testing infrastructure supporting \textbf{hundreds of concurrent experiments}. Algorithmic metrics proxying for downstream outcomes that scale across recommendations for hundreds of millions of users. AI evaluation systems \textbf{easy to set up, maintain, and accurate} across all use cases. Scaled, high leverage teams and products. No firedrills. No one-off solutions. No low value-add work.

\subsection*{Spotify (2022-present)}

\subsubsection*{Director of Data Science (2023-Present)}

I lead teams of data scientists responsible for personalizing the Home, Search, and promotions experience on Spotify, which accounts for 75\% of consumption for 700 million users. Key initiatives include: \\

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{AI Evaluation and Fine tuning} Lead teams of ML engineers and data scientists to build AI evaluation systems (including LLMs as Judges) and refine the ML reward functions across Spotify's generative recommendations systems.  
    \item \textbf{Connecting Product Metrics to Business Outcomes}: Built company-level measurement systems aligning short-term engagement signals with long-term retention and revenue, eliminating guesswork and accelerating decision velocity across recommendation surfaces.
    \item \textbf{Enhancing Discovery and Engagement}: Drove projects that resulted in substantial increases in user discovery and engagement with new video content formats, contributing to significant growth in overall platform engagement and retention.
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection*{Senior Insights Leader (2022-2023)}

I guided teams of data scientists and user researchers in developing personalization algorithms and optimizing impression economics, significantly influencing user experience for 400+ million daily users on the Spotify Home and effectively distributing all Spotify content types.

\subsection*{Zalando SE (2017-2022)}

I built and managed a cross-functional organization that developed frameworks, tools, and services aimed at fostering deep customer relationships at Zalando.

\subsubsection*{Director of Economics and Experimentation (2020-2022, Head 2019-2020)}

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Measuring the right things}: I led managers of teams comprised of economists, data scientists, engineers, and product managers to redefine Zalando's customer-centric KPI framework. This initiative was pivotal in delivering long-term value to customers and operationalizing insights across the company.
    \item \textbf{Scaling incremental impact research software and services}: I spearheaded the development of Zalando's large-scale A/B testing platform and a broad program that employed causal machine learning methods to assess incremental impacts, enhancing company-wide decision-making processes.
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection*{Economics Head (2017-2019)}

I established and led a team of economists, engineers, and product managers that developed Zalando’s real-time, machine-learned content recommendation system, significantly expanding the company’s advertising capabilities and enriching customer content diversity and quality.
