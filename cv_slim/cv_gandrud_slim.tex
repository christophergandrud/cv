\section*{Work Experiences}

\subsection*{Zalando SE}

I build and manage cross-functional teams that bring scientific innovations to production. Empathy is at the core of my management style. Empathising with customers enables my teams to work on what is important. Empathising with my team members enables me to focus on how to improve our processes to create high impact teams and great places to work. 

\subsubsection*{Head of Economics and Experimentation (from 2019)}

\begin{itemize}

  \item \textbf{Measuring the right things}: I guide teams of economists, data scientists, and product managers redeveloping Zalando's KPI framework and how we evaluate product investments for long-term strategic success.

  \item \textbf{Measuring incremental impact}: I lead the development of Zalando's large scale A/B testing platform (service receives 10s of thousands of requests per second) and broader program to enable teams throughout the company to measure their incremental impact with causal machine learning methods. I guide research into new machine learning methods and their application in production.

\end{itemize}
  
\subsubsection*{Economics Team Lead (2017-2019)}

I created and led a cross-functional team of engineers, product managers, data scientists, and economists to develop Zalando's \textbf{real-time and machine-learned content recommendation system}. We built a platform that dramatically expanded Zalando's on-site advertising business. Our work improved the customer experience by expanding the diversity and quality of on-site fashion content.
